# 🧠 Image Classification with Quantum Neural Networks (QNN)

This repository demonstrates hybrid **classical–quantum** approaches for image classification, built in Python using Qiskit. It includes a Jupyter notebook exploring quantum neural networks (QNNs), and quantum circuit simulations.

---

### 🧩 Notebooks Overview - **Image Classification with qSLP.ipynb**
- Implements a hybrid neural network with **quantum single-layer perceptron (qSLP)**
- Uses MNIST (or FashionMNIST) samples
- Demonstrates data encoding into qubits, parameterized quantum layers, measurement, and a final classical output layer
- Showcases training, accuracy/loss plots, and comparison with baseline performance
